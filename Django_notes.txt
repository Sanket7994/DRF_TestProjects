Django Structure:

• __init__.py indicates that the files in the folder are part of a Python package. Without
this file, we cannot import files from another directory which we will be doing a lot of in
Django!
• asgi.py allows for an optional Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface18 to be run
• settings.py controls our Django project’s overall settings
• urls.py tells Django which pages to build in response to a browser or URL request
• wsgi.py stands for Web Server Gateway Interface19 which helps Django serve our eventual
web pages

Each new pages app file does:

Code
├── pages
│ ├── __init__.py
│ ├── admin.py
│ ├── apps.py
│ ├── migrations
│ │ └── __init__.py
│ ├── models.py
│ ├── tests.py
│ └── views.py


• admin.py is a configuration file for the built-in Django Admin app
• apps.py is a configuration file for the app itself
• migrations/ keeps track of any changes to our models.py file so it stays in sync with our
database
• models.py is where we define our database models which Django automatically translates
into database tables
• tests.py is for app-specific tests
• views.py is where we handle the request/response logic for our web app
